# Day 11 Project - Blackjack Game (Capstone)
#
# Create a black jack game in python, where you play against
# the dealer. You are given two cards at random, with the value of 
# of cards being what the number is (for number cards) and for face 
# cards it is a value of 10.
#
# You place a bet, dealer deals the cards. You can call on your hand
# if you want or just fold and end the game. If you call and exceed 21, 
# you lose, if you are closer to 21 than the dealer, you win!
