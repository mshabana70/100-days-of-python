# Day 12 Project - Number Guessing Game
#
# Build a game where you are to guess a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.
# You can select a difficulty between easy, medium and hard.
#
# Easy, you have 10 attempts to guess the number correctly
# Medium, you have 7 attempts to guess the number correctly
# Hard, you have 5 attempts to guess the number correctly
#
# If you guess is above the target number, you will get a response of "Too High"
# If you guess is below the target number, you will get a response of "Too Low"
#
# Game will end once you are out of attempts
