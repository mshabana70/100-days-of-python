# Life in Weeks

# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that 
# tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left 
# if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output 
# a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
#
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated 
# numbers.
#
#
# Example Input: How old are you in years?
#
# 56
#
#
# Example Output:
# 
# You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
