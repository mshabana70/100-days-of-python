# Day 13 Notes - Debugging
#
# Describe the problem: 
# my_function is running a iterative for loop that goes through
# the range 1 (inclusive) and 20 (exclusive).
# The for loop has a condition that is check at each iteration. If 
# the value of i is equal to 20, then print "you got it". 
# The current issue is that nothing is being return by the function.
#
# 
def my_function():
    for i in range(1, 20):
        if i == 20:
            print("You got it")
my_function()

# # Reproduce the Bug
# from random import randint
# dice_imgs = ["❶", "❷", "❸", "❹", "❺", "❻"]
# dice_num = randint(1, 6)
# print(dice_imgs[dice_num])

# # Play Computer
# year = int(input("What's your year of birth?"))
# if year > 1980 and year < 1994:
#   print("You are a millenial.")
# elif year > 1994:
#   print("You are a Gen Z.")

# # Fix the Errors
# age = input("How old are you?")
# if age > 18:
# print("You can drive at age {age}.")

# #Print is Your Friend
# pages = 0
# word_per_page = 0
# pages = int(input("Number of pages: "))
# word_per_page == int(input("Number of words per page: "))
# total_words = pages * word_per_page
# print(total_words)

# #Use a Debugger
# def mutate(a_list):
#   b_list = []
#   for item in a_list:
#     new_item = item * 2
#   b_list.append(new_item)
#   print(b_list)

# mutate([1,2,3,5,8,13])
