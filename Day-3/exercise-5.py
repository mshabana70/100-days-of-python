# Exercise 5 - Love Calculator
#
#
#
# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.
# 
# To work out the love score between two people:
# 
# Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs. 
# 
# Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs. 
# 
# Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
# 
# For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:
#
# "Your score is **x**, you go together like coke and mentos."
# 
# For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:
# 
# "Your score is **y**, you are alright together."
# 
# Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:
# 
# "Your score is **z**."
# 
# e.g.
# 
# name1 = "Angela Yu"
# name2 = "Jack Bauer"
# 
# T occurs 0 times
# R occurs 1 time
# U occurs 2 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 5
# 
# L occurs 1 time
# O occurs 0 times
# V occurs 0 times
# E occurs 2 times
# Total = 3
# 
# Love Score = 53
# 
# Print: "Your score is 53."

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
print("Welcome to the Love Calculator!")

name2 = input("What is their name? \n")

#Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# len() gives us the count of that array
