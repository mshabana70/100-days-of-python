# Exercise 4 - Pizza Order Practice
# 
# Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
# 
# Small Pizza: $15
# 
# Medium Pizza: $20
# 
# Large Pizza: $25
# 
# Pepperoni for Small Pizza: +$2
# 
# Pepperoni for Medium or Large Pizza: +$3
# 
# Extra cheese for any size pizza: + $1
# 
# Example Input:
# 
# size = "L"
# add_pepperoni = "Y"
# extra_cheese = "N"
# 
# Example Output:
# 
# Your final bill is: $28

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
