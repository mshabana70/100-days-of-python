# Exercise 2 - Dictionary in List
#
#
# You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. 
# You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 
# Dictionaries.
# 
# Write a function that will work with the following line of 
# code on line 21 to add the entry for Russia to the travel_log.
# 
# add_new_country("Russia", 2, ["Moscow", "Saint Petersburg"])
# You've visited Russia 2 times.
# 
# You've been to Moscow and Saint Petersburg.
# 
# DO NOT modify the travel_log directly. You need to create a 
# function that modifies it.
