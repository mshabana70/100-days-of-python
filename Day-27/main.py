# Day 27 - GUI in Python

# The library we will use to build a GUI will be TKinter
import tkinter

# Similar to the screen object we were creating in turtle
window = tkinter.Tk()
window.title("My First GUI Program") # give our window a title
window.minsize(width = 500, height = 300)


# Label








window.mainloop() # runs a loop to keep our window on the screen and listen for user action
