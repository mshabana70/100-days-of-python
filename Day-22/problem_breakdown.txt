Day 22 Project - Pong Game

TODO: Breakdown the problem into separate components

- We would possibly need a separate class for the scoreboard 
that inherits from the "turtle" module
- We would have a separate class for the paddle objects
- We would have a separate class for the ball
- And finally a class to create he field of play


8 pieces:

1. Create a screen
2. Create and move a paddle
3. Create another paddle (two player game)
4. Create the ball and make it move
5. Detect collision of ball with wall and bounce
6. Detect collision with paddle
7. Detect when paddle misses
8. Keep Score
