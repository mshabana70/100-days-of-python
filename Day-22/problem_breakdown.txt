Day 22 Project - Pong Game

TODO: Breakdown the problem into separate components

- We would possibly need a separate class for the scoreboard 
that inherits from the "turtle" module
- We would have a separate class for the paddle objects
- We would have a separate class for the ball
- And finally a class to create he field of play
